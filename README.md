##### a personal project to improve my tableau knowledge

### Dataset

- The main data is [Covid world vaccination progress](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress), made by [Gabriel Preda](https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda) on kaggle.
- I also use [World population](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav/world-population) data to give more context. this is made by [Rishav Sharma](https://www.kaggle.com/rsrishav) on kaggle.

# Covid Vaccine Progress Dashboard
With both of those data, I make a dashboard containing descriptive analysis that shows the vaccination progress of each country. I also Implement a data filtering based on the country with the world map I've made at the top of the dashboard, so you will be able to filter out which country to be included. There's a lot to be improved. But as my first project, I'm quite happy with the result and most importantly, I've learn a lot about tableau.
